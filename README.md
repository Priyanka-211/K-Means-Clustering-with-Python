# K-Means-Clustering-with-Python
This project presents a conceptual understanding of the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm using a dataset applied in a Jupyter Notebook. It aims to explore unsupervised learning, cluster formation, and evaluation of clusters without diving into the codebase.

## 🧠 What is K-Means?

**K-Means** is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into **K distinct clusters**, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). It’s one of the most popular clustering techniques due to its simplicity and scalability.

## 📌 Objective of the Project

- To understand the working mechanism of K-Means
- To determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
- To visualize how K-Means separates data points into clusters
- To evaluate how well the clusters align with any ground truth labels (if available)

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ How K-Means Works

1. **Initialization**: Select `k` initial centroids randomly.
2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the closest centroid.
3. **Update**: Compute new centroids as the average of points in each cluster.
4. **Repeat**: Iterate the assignment and update steps until centroids stabilize or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## 📈 Choosing the Optimal Number of Clusters

- **Elbow Method** is used to determine the ideal value for `k`. This is done by plotting the **inertia** (sum of squared distances to centroids) against different values of `k` and selecting the point where the curve starts to level off ("elbow point").

## 🔍 Cluster Evaluation

- If labeled data is available, clustering performance can be roughly compared with true labels.
- Metrics such as the number of correctly labeled samples (matching with actual labels) may be computed.
- Visualization helps in interpreting the clusters formed.

## 📝 Conclusion
In this project, I have implemented the most popular unsupervised clustering technique called K-Means Clustering.

I have applied the elbow method and find that k=2 (k is number of clusters) can be considered a good number of cluster to cluster this data.

I have find that the model has very high inertia240.06686397262814572. So, this is not a good model fit to the data.

I have achieved a weak classification accuracy of 1% with k=2 by our unsupervised model.

So, I have changed the value of k and find relatively higher classification accu58cy of 62% with k=4.

Hence, we can conclude that k=4 being the optimal number of clusters.
